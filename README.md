Postgres, Flask, React Typescript

MVP:

- 2 roles, manager and worker
- Manager can CRUD tools
- Manager can add and remove worker
- Worker can borrow and return back tool
- Require approval from manager, for borrowing and returning tool

Stretch Goals:

- Search and filter
- Push notification for approval (for both worker and manager), using socket
- Chat, using socket
- Upload tool's picture, using AWS or Cloudinary
- Borrow and return must be nearby the physical store (using geolocation)
- Dashboard/analytics, e.g. tool tracking (who borrow, borrow duration per worker, tool usage for past X months/years)
